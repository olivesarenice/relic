- Meal Subscriptions: Offer a meal plan subscription that gives people affordable, protein-packed meals each week. By locking customers into a subscription, you can lower costs for them (due to bulk buying) and increase your margins.
Protein Snack Box: If complete meals are out of the question, another approach could be offering protein-packed snack boxes for fitness enthusiasts or busy professionals who need quick protein fixes between meals.
